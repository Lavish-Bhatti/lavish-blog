        <p>My Journey – Lavish Bhatti

Hey, I’m Lavish Bhatti – a student at IIT BHU, currently in Civil Engineering, but my real passion lies in tech and development.

Back in 2024, I gave JEE Advanced and got a category rank of 2323. I wasn’t satisfied, so I pushed myself harder and gave it another shot in 2025—and improved to 2125. That grind taught me a lot about focus, consistency, and never giving up.

Even though I got Civil, my aim is to switch to Computer Science because I want to become a full-stack developer. I’ve already started learning HTML, CSS, and now diving into JavaScript and backend tech like MongoDB. I've built some cool projects too—like a calculator and an Amazon clone using HTML & CSS.

Apart from coding, I also love content creation. I’ve got an Insta page with over 33K followers, where I post fitness content, reels, and edits. I'm also into gaming—especially Free Fire—and I enjoy playing with my close friends.

This is just the beginning. My goal is to grow as a developer, build real-world projects, and maybe one day start something of my own. I believe in learning by doing, staying consistent, and trusting the process.
